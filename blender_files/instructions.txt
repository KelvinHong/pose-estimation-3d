To add new models, 
start with a 3D model with a T shape or A shape body.
Then, in Blender, import the model and let it facing the X axis direction.
Fit an armature to the body. (There is a Blender plugin for human armature.)
Note that arms should not be bent, means the angle of elbow bent
should be nearly 180 degree. 
A strict T shape or A shape only.
Parent the armature to the body with automatic weights.
Make sure the armature works on the body by swinging the bones. 

Select body and armature, export to model.fbx with options:
- Path Mode: Copy, Embed Textures
- Limit to selected objects
- Armature: Deselect "Add Leaf Bones"

Store in a folder in "blender_files/" like any other folders.
